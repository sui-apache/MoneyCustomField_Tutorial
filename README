Demo Money Custom Field Jira Plugin.

A working plugin with fixed errors, created following outdated Atlassian tutorial:
https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/creating-a-custom-field-in-jira/

Some errors which was fixed:
- Atlassian Spring Scanner usega fully removed, including annotations (e.g. @Scanned, @Overrride) and class imports into package.
- Dependency org.mockito was added to pom.xml so 'atlas-run' won't throw an error when trying to run tests.
- #disable_html_escaping() was added to edit.vm

Full documentation is always available at:

https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK

(but it's definitely outdated so keep in mind)
